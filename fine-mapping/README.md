# Fine-mapping with functional genomics annotations

These workflows were initially developed by [Min Qiao](https://github.com/minqiao) when she was student at Xin He Lab, University of Chicago. The development continues at Columbia Neurology. 

This folder contains the original work mostly by Min before 2020. Continued work can be found at: https://cumc.github.io/xqtl-pipeline/ We suggest users focus on the new development. This folder is for archiving purpose.
